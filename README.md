# DP-Camp
We are currently post world war two and I would like to help people locate their lost relatives/acquaintances. I therefore need all the dp's info recorded so that the process can be smooth and quick.

I am asking the public at large to submit database table scripts to implement this database table.

## Spec
The full spec is included in the repo in the file called DP Camp-spec.txt.

## Deliverables
The 3 files listed below are required to implement the requirements for this repo. The info for each one is in the spec.
1. database.sql 
2. table.sql
3. sampledata.sql
4. reports.sql

## SQL Requirements
- primary key
- properly named columns
- proper data types
- not null as appropriate
- constraints
- files should be able to run repeatedly so include drop and use statements
